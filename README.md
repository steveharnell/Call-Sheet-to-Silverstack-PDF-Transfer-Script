# Call Sheet to Silverstack PDF Transfer Script

An AppleScript that automatically extracts crew information from film/TV production call sheets (PDFs) and transfers it to Silverstack/Silverstack XT's Project Overview fields.

- Extracts text from production call sheet PDFs
- Parses crew member names and production information

1. Open Silverstack/Silverstack XT
2. Navigate to the **Project Overview** page
3. Click in the **Project Name** field to ensure it's selected

### Step 2: Run the Script

2. Click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
3. Choose your Silverstack version:
   - **Version 9.x** - for Silverstack XT (has Location field)
   - **Version 8.x** - for Silverstack (has Shooting Day field)

### Step 3: Select Your Call Sheet

3. Review the extracted information in the preview dialog

### Step 4: Transfer Data
1. Verify the extracted information is correct
2. Ensure the Project Name field is selected in Silverstack
3. Click **Transfer** to fill in all fields automatically

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Cannot access Silverstack window" Error
- Ensure Script Editor has accessibility permissions
- Make sure Silverstack is running and the Project Overview is visible
- Try restarting both applications

### Script Copies Wrong Text
- The script now handles focus issues automatically
- If problems persist, try closing other applications
- Use the alternative extraction method in the debug menu

### No Text Extracted from PDF
- Ensure the PDF has selectable text (not a scanned image)
- Try opening the PDF in Preview and manually selecting text
- Some PDFs may have unusual formatting that prevents extraction

### Fields Not Found
The script looks for specific text patterns. Your call sheet should have:
- "Job:" followed by the project name
- Crew positions listed with names (e.g., "Director    Adriana Cruz")
- Standard film industry role titles

## üêõ Debug Menu

If you encounter issues, run the debug menu by calling `debugMenu()`:

1. **Check Accessibility Permissions** - Verifies Script Editor can control Silverstack
2. **Test PDF Text Extraction** - Shows what text is extracted from your PDF
3. **Test Text Input** - Tests typing sample data into Silverstack
4. **Full Extraction Test** - Runs extraction and shows results without transferring
5. **Run Normal Transfer** - Executes the standard workflow

## üìù Call Sheet Format

The script works best with call sheets that follow standard film/TV production formats:

```
Job: Project Name
CLIENT: Production Company
LOCATION: Shooting Location

TITLE    NAME                CELL           EMAIL
Director McG                310.555.1212   email@domain.com
DP       Bob Yeoman         310.555.3213   email@domain.com
1st AC   John Holmes        818.555.6969   email@domain.com
...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

To add support for additional fields or different call sheet formats:

1. Modify the field detection patterns in the `findNameNearRole()` function
2. Add new field names to the `fieldList` arrays
3. Update the parsing logic to handle your specific format
